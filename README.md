### About me 

My name is **Winston Tsui!** I'm a Computer Science student who loves coding and programming. I like to create, experiment and develop technical applications, and am generally passionate about using code and technology as part of digitally-based solutions to some of our biggest challenges in healthcare technology, media and finance. 

I am experienced in multiple CS domains, including Graphics (C++, OpenGL), Data Analysis (Python, Scikit-learn), Virtual Reality (C#, Unity), Pervasive Computing (Android Studio, Kotlin), Operating Systems, Algorithms and Data Structures. In my free time, I have developed full stack e-commerce, portfolio and messaging applications using languages such as Dart and JavaScript and also frameworks such as daisyUI, React and Next.js. (Check out my open source code at https://github.com/winstontsui). I have experience deploying these applications on the Play Store and on the web using Netlify and Vercel. (Check out my website at https://melodic-capybara-ca9ddd.netlify.app/). My software engineering experience thoroughly encompasses multiple programming languages, frameworks and technologies, spanning from version control knowledge of Git and GitHub to SQL database design and MongoDB.

My research interest lies in full-stack software engineering incorporating machine learning (ML) predictive analytics features. Dr. Hoda Eldardity's work from Virginia Tech is a great example- addressing challenges in extracting new attribute-value pairs with limited labeled data through a multi-label learning framework. Her deep learning research using dynamic threshold learning for multi-label inference has shown significant improvement in unseen scenarios. I‚Äôm motivated by this research because scientific data extraction can drastically improve our current automated analysis of clinical diagnostics; this is something I want to explore.

I see myself utilizing my technical expertise in web development and Android development to create digital solutions to some of the our most pressing challenges, especially healthcare technology and ML predictive-analytics based work.

Hoping to become a software engineer one dayüôè
